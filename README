==ABOUT==

I wrote this tool to manage my AMD GPUs and memclocks, fanspeeds and temperatures graphically in Linux. 

I also wanted to implement mining in some form, but this is kind of hard b/c phoenix.py updates constantly and I would have to read that info into the GUI, which I did not manage to achieve yet. The according file is called "MyPressedMiners.java", however I deleted the GUI code from the  WindowContainer class.

As is, the tool does a fairly good job of managing and monitoring up to 4 GPU's in your Linux system. You might have to adjust the source code for your needs.

==INSTALLATION==

1) Make sure you have Java installed on your OS (I only tested the tool with Linux, but it may run on any OS that uses the aticonfig executable)
2) To install you just have to take the jar file out of the dist folder and put it some place convenient for you.

==RUN==

Run with
"java -jar lfcc.jar"

==TROUBLESHOOTING==

THe program may crash after some time due too many open aticonfig commands. This has to be fixed yet and the behaviour is expected.

Make sure the permissions of the fancontrol.sh and overclock.sh files are set to executable for your user, this should be done by the Java program itself usually.

The file fancontrol get created when you click on "commit" button for the first time. 

The file overclock gets created when you click on the "set" button for the first time. 

These files are necessary to be in the folder of the lfcc.jar file when you run the program. Alternatively you can adjust the folder path in the GUI.

==ROADMAP==

to implement for future versions:
- add persistent clocks, after restart of fcc
- fix aticonfig crash bug
- implement python bitcoin mining (phoenix has to be altered because it conflicts with the buffered/filereader of the Java API)


ANY HELP OR SUGGESTION IS WELCOME
