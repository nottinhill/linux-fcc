Current Version is alpha 0.1

==INSTALLATION==

To install you just have to take the jar file out of the dist folder and put it some place convenient for you.

==RUN==

Run with
"java -jarlfcc.jar"

Make sure to set permissions of the created fancontrol.sh file to executable for your user with "chmod 750 fancontrol.sh" until I implemented this by default.
The file fancontrol get created when you click on "commit" button for the first time.

==ROADMAP==

to implement for ver. beta 0.1
- get rid of phoenix logic, since I failed to implement bitcoin mining based on pyhton
- add persistent clocks, after restart of fcc

ANY HELP OR SUGGESTION IS WELCOME
