Current Version is alpha 0.1

==INSTALLATION==

1) Make sure you have Java installed on your OS (I only tested the tool with Linux, but it may run on any OS that uses the aticonfig executable)
2) To install you just have to take the jar file out of the dist folder and put it some place convenient for you.

==RUN==

Run with
"java -jar lfcc.jar"

==IMPORTANT==

Make sure to set permissions of the fancontrol.sh and overclock.sh files to executable for your user with "chmod 750 fancontrol.sh" until I implemented this by default.
The file fancontrol get created when you click on "commit" button for the first time. The file overclock gets not created yet. These files are 100% necessary to be in the folder of the lfcc.jar file when you run tehe program

==ROADMAP==

to implement for ver. beta 0.1
- get rid of phoenix logic, since I failed to implement bitcoin mining based on pyhton
- add persistent clocks, after restart of fcc

ANY HELP OR SUGGESTION IS WELCOME
